# Transmission Media
#### Taxonomy of Transmission Media

#### Some Really Bad News
- In the real world, entropy rules
- Transmission is plagued with problems

#### Loss, Interference, and Electrical Noise
- Problems in the electrical and electromagnetic worlds
	- Resistance (leads to loss)
	- Capacitance (leads to distortion)
	- Inductance (leads to interference)
- Random electromagnetic radiation is called noise
	- Can be generated by specific sources such as electric motors
	- Background radiation is an inescapable feature of the universe

#### How can the Effect of Noise on Copper Wiring be Reduced?
- Several techniques
	- Unshielded twisted pair
	- Coaxial
	- Shielded twisted pair
- All used in computer networks

#### How Twisted Pair Helps
- In an untwisted pair of wires, more current is generated in the first wire the interference hits
- Twisting a wire exposes each wire equally 

#### Coaxial Cable and Shielding
- Better protection: wrap a metal shield around the wire that carries the signal
- Shielding can be added to twisted pair
	- Around entire cable containing many pairs
	- Around each pair as well as around cable
- Shielding determines maximum data rate

#### Wiring Standards and Data Rates
- As bitrate increases, the size of a bit goes down
- The cosmic background radiation causes more problems as bits get smaller since any kind of energy that gets through could potentially destroy the bit

#### Media Using Light Energy
- InfraRED transmission (short range, low data rate)
- Point-to-point (useful between buildings)
- Optical fiber (high data rate, long distance)
- Why light stays in a fiber

#### Satellite Communication
- Low Earth Orbit
	- Easy to send shuttles to and cheap to launch
	- Latency is significantly lower
- Medium Earth Orbit
	- An elliptical (rather than circular) orbit primarily used to provide communication at the North and South Poles
- Geostationary Earth Orbit
	- Has the advantage that satellite remains at a fixed position w/ respect to a location on the earth's surface, but the disadvantage of being far away

#### GEO Satellites
- Distance to GEO satellite is 35,785 km
- Approximately 3 times the earth's diameter
- A consequence for networking: long round tip trip even at the speed of light
	- 0.238 sec

#### Channel Capacity
- Nyquist's theorem gives theoretical bound on maximum data rate for hardware bandwidth B and K signal levels
	- $D = 2B\log_2K$
- A mathematical result known as Shannon's Theorem gives the maximum channel capacity, C, in the presence of noise
	- $C = B\log_2(1+S/N)$
	- Maximum channel capacity: Bits per second I can send across the wire with noise
- Quantity $S/N$ is known as the signal-to-noise ratio
