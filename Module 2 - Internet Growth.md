# Module 2 - Internet Growth
#### Actual Size of the Internet
- The previous plots are somewhat misleading
	- Sizes are derived by walking the DNS, so only hosts with permanent IP addresses are counted
- Since around 2000, many Internet devices do not have a permanent IP address
- By 2007 more users accessed the Internet through smart phones than through computers w/ permanent addresses
- Starting around 2010 the move to cloud computing meant fewer servers needed unique IP addresses
