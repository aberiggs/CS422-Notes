# Access And Interconnection Technologies
#### Definition of Access
- Used in the "last mile" between a provider and subscriber
- Informally classified as either narrowband or broadband
- May not be the bottleneck
- Many access technologies are asymmetric (e.g. higher data rate downstream)

#### Access Technology Types
- Narrowband (less than 128 Kbps)
	- Dialup
	- Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
	- Has almost disappeared in the U.S.
- Broadband (more than 128 Kbps)
	- Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
	- Cable modems
	- Wireless (e.g. Wi-Fi and 4G/5G)

#### Digital Subscriber Line Technologies
- Use frequency-devision multiplexing to share local loop between data and Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
- Head-end equipment is DSL Access Multiplexor (DSLAM)
- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
	- 255 downstream carrier frequencies, 31 upstream
	- Maximum downstream data rate is 8.45 Mbps
	- Adaptive selection of carrier frequencies

#### Cable Modem Technology
- Sends data over CATV coaxial cable system
- Issue was originally that cable was a simplex connection
	- One way
- Standard is DOCSIS
- Head-end equipment known as Cable Modem Termination System
- 
- Modern cable systems use
	- Optical fiber from the head end to curb-side boxes
	- Are shifting from copper to optical for connections to individual subscribers
- Will an individual subscriber pay enough to justify optical data rates?

#### Wireless and other Wired Access Technologies
- Wi-Fi
- Satellite
- 4g and 5G cellular
- Leased point-to-point data circuits (e.g., T1 or fractional T1)

#### Interconnections at the Core of the Internet
- Typically needed by large ISPs
- Circuits leased from common carriers (phone companies)
- Terminated with a Data Service Unit / Channel Service Unit (DSU/CSU)
- Upstream interface aggregates many lower-speed access connections
- Key idea: data rates are based on voice
	- Basic data rate: single digital voice channel (64Kbps)
	- Higher data rate circuits created from multiples of voice channels
- SONET encoding and framing used
