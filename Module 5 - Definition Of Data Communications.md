# Module 5 - Definition of Data Communications (The Basis of the Physical Layer)
## Motivation & Model
#### What is Data Communications
- Broad
- Usually associated with the Physical Layer
- Includes
	- Transmission of signals
	- Encoding data
	- Modulation and multiplexing

#### Motivation
- Find ways to transmit analog and digital information
- Data communication provides
	- A conceptual framework
	- A very practical and useful mathematical basis

#### Key Concept
- *"Although we tend to think of analog and digital communication separately, ultimately, all communication uses the same physical phenomena, usually electromagnetic energy."*
- Differences lie in the way the physical phenomena are used
	- Analog: use all values in a continuous range
	- Digital: restrict use to a fixed set of values, usually two
- Data communications cover both analog and digital'
